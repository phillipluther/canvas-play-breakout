# canvas-play-breakout

Just goofballin' around with canvas and 2D game dev; a simple hobby project to learn for the sake of learning.

I'm essentially following along with [this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript) from MDN and adding some tooling/organization just for my own sanity.

Play a demo [here](https://phillipluther.github.io/canvas-play-breakout/demo).
